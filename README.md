## Project Inforamtion <br>
Creating an interface for the blind people which will help them in their day to day life,
The system will be wireless and offline based.

## Challenges faced <br>
Training action detection algorithm in a such a short time and getting its accuracy so that its usable

Syncing hardware buttons with software so that a smooth process is enabled

Keeping the product as simple as possible while not losing on any basics that is keeping the product simple so that it is easily used by a blind person and keeping features so that it helps him/her in his daily routine.

## Execution and Contribution <br>
 Naman Bansal @psifrous  - Using MQTT protocol to integrate physical buttons & setting up protocol for live stream using Nginx engine
